# 🏦 Banking System – C++

A console-based **Banking System** implemented in C++ using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**, and **input validation**.  
This project simulates core banking operations like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and admin-only account viewing.  
It also features a **colored, animated console interface** for an engaging user experience.

## 🎯 Objective
This project was developed as part of my **internship** to strengthen my skills in:
- **C++ programming**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- **File handling**
- **Input validation**
- **Console UI enhancements**

The aim was to create a **real-world simulation** of a banking system with proper data handling and security measures.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **C++**
- `fstream` for file handling
- Windows API for console colors (`<windows.h>`)
- `<thread>` & `<chrono>` for animation effects
- `<conio.h>` for secure password input

🔐 Admin Access
Default password: admin123

You can change it inside the main.cpp file in the Admin section.
